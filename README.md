## Huffman compression algorithm
using C11 standard

1. Huffman encoding and decoding algorithm with my own implementation of data structures (like priority queue, huffman binary tree).
2. Peer-to-peer file transfer between sender/receiver over TCP IPv4 sockets.

If you have any question ask me! @TomasSobek
